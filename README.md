# Study Timer  

## Overview  
This is a simple Python-based **study timer** that allows users to set a countdown in minutes. It provides a **real-time countdown display** and plays a **beep sound** when the timer ends.  

## Features  
- Allows users to set a custom **study duration**.  
- Displays a **live countdown timer** in `MM:SS` format.  
- Plays a **beep alert** when the timer ends.  
- Supports **KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C)** to stop the timer.  
- Handles **invalid inputs gracefully**.  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3+  
- **Windows OS** (since `winsound` is Windows-only)
